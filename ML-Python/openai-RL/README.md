Classic control problem from the RL literature.
CartPole-v0.
Neural network trained to play the game without any prior knowledge.
To run you need to install: tensorflow-gpu, gym[all] (atari is included). 
Neural network uses differentiable function (relu) as activation function, also AdamOptimizer.
Any suggestion is welcome :)
